uLocate
=======

uLocate is a collaborative Umbraco package which aims to provide Geography data types for Umbraco based on the Microsoft SQL Server Geography type.

This package will only work using a SQL Server database.

This version will remove the dependency of the SQL CLR Types requirement to be installed on the webserver.
